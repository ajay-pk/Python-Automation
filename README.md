# Python-Automation

Python Automation here is making daily tasks and tasks we google automated with python scripts.
These tasks can be run either from the terminal or using a program software with a GUI.

This was a fun project to do, because to automate tasks like combining pdf and downloading youtube videos is a real life scenario solution.

Implementing the software with basic and minimal UI was necessary due to the limitations of python
